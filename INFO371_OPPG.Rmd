## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readtext)
library(tidyverse)

corp_aiact <- readtext("AI_Act_Commission.pdf")

corp_council <- readtext("Council statement Fall  2022 - ST-14954-2022-INIT_en.pdf")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
corp_aiact
corp_council
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
